This project is meant to be a small robot that can move a camera in two direction using two servos
Computer vision algorithms track the user's face and export coordinates and the servos adjust the position of the camera so the face is always in the middle of the frame
I used a raspberry pi for this, with 3d printed parts.
Coming soon, a small display to show the robot's "eyes"
